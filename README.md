## Install

```bash
yarn add eslint-config-heaven --dev
```

## Usage

Shareable configs are designed to work with the `extends` feature of `.eslintrc` files.
You can learn more about
[Shareable Configs](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs) on the
official ESLint website.

This Shareable Config adds my personal style to override the rules provided in `eslint-config-xxxx`.

After install, add this to your `.eslintrc` file:

```
{
  "extends": ["heaven"]
}
```
